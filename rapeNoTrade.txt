The next morning Barbara Strozzi insists that you 
only focus on the music to distract your mind. You
take her advice and focus solely on perfecting your
piece in time for the ball. After several days it’s
time for the big audition and you pile into the 
carriage on your way to Palazzo Priuli Bon for Filippo
Bon’s party. People see you arrive with the Strozzi’s 
and see you being acknowledged by Francesco and Ettore 
Tron of the Tron family. It is your turn to go on 
stage. You thank Barbara for helping you with your music. 
You absolutely nail your audition and at the end of your
performance Filippo Bron whisks you away from the 
tradeswoman and welcomes you into his patronage. You 
have enough prestige to begin an illustrious career as 
a musician in Florence and forget all about the tradeswoman. 

Congratulations on becoming part of Florentine society!
