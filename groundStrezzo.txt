You stand your ground in this roomful of powerful 
and influential people laughing at you trying to save
your dignity. At Richard Lassels silence a voice booms
out yelling, “Would you dare say the same to my daughters 
face? She who has a voice and mind gifted to her by 
God himself?” Guilio Strozzi steps forward. The room goes
silent as Guilio Strozzi asks for you to play, to prove 
them wrong for laughing at you.
